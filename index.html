Taylor Swift
    </h1>
    <p>Taylor Alison Swift is a 34 year old American singer and song-writer who was born <br|> on December 13 1989. Taylor started her music career in 2005 when she was only 16 <br> years old. She began her career writing and singing country music, and her <br> debut album was called “Taylor Swift”. She published this album in 2006, and her songs <br> “Teardrops on my Guitar” and “Our Song” became big hits throughout country <br> music. Later on, Taylor released her 2nd album in 2008 which was called “Fearless”. <br> Her songs “Love Story” and “You Belong With Me” found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. Taylor Swift won her first Grammy with her album Fearless. <br>

When Taylor released her 3rd album “Speak Now”, she experimented with rock and pop (2010), and <br> on her album “Red”(2012), she experimented with electronic. Both <br> albums had major hits. Her album Red included hits such as All Too Well, I Knew <br> You Were Trouble, We are never ever getting back together and 22. Her next album <br> 1989 was her first full pop album, and it was all about enjoying her time with her friends and moving to New York. The album was named after the year she was born in. This album made Taylor Swift an extremely popular singer, and she was known and recognised. Her songs “Blank Space”, “Bad Blood”and "Shake It Off” went down in history and are still known to this day. <br>

After Taylor Swift released her album 1989, she had a big break for three years. This was due to people shaming her for all the men she had dated and haters commenting snake emojis on her posts , and it had lots of people wondering if Taylor had stopped making music. But she came back stronger than ever in 2017 with her album “Reputation”. This album came as a shock to her fans who call themselves Swifties, because instead of being ashamed of haters calling her a snake, she wrote a whole album about people calling her a snake and the rumors they made about her. The album contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one single “Look What You Made Me Do”. Fans later found out Taylor was hiding with her boyfriend Joe Alwyn in the period of time where she had disappeared. She had dated Joe Alwyn for 6 years, but they shockingly broke up in 2022.

Taylor had to start re-recording her Big Machine albums in 2021, due to her albums being sold without her permission. She wanted ownership of her albums, so she named her re-recorded albums Taylor’s Version.
