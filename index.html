Taylor Swift
    </h1>
    <p>Taylor Alison Swift is a 34 year old American singer and song-writer who was born <br> on December 13 1989. Taylor started her music career in 2005 when she was only 16 <br> years old. She began her career writing and singing country music, and her <br> debut album was called “Taylor Swift”. She published this album in 2006, and her songs <br> “Teardrops on my Guitar” and “Our Song” became big hits throughout country <br> music. Later on, Taylor released her 2nd album in 2008 which was called “Fearless”. <br> Her songs “Love Story” and “You Belong With Me” found crossover success on <br> country and pop radio formats. Taylor Swift won her first Grammy with her album <br> Fearless. <br>

When Taylor released her 3rd album “Speak Now”, she experimented with rock and <br> pop (2010), and on her album “Red”(2012), she experimented with electronic. Both <br> albums had major hits. Her album Red included hits such as All Too Well, I Knew <br> You Were Trouble, We are never ever getting back together and 22. Her next album <br> 1989 was her first full pop album, and it was all about enjoying her time with her <br> friends and moving to New York. The album was named after the year she was <br> born in. This album made Taylor Swift an extremely popular singer, and she was <br> known and recognised. Her songs “Blank Space”, “Bad Blood”and "Shake It Off” <br> went down in history and are still known to this day. <br>

After Taylor Swift released her album 1989, she had a big break for three years. <br> This was due to people shaming her for all the men she had dated and haters <br> commenting snake emojis on her posts , and it had lots of people wondering if <br> Taylor had stopped making music. But she came back stronger than ever in 2017 <br> with her album “Reputation”. This album came as a shock to her fans who call <br> themselves Swifties, because instead of being ashamed of haters calling her a <br> snake, she wrote a whole album about people calling her a snake and the rumors <br> they made about her. The album contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one single <br> “Look What You Made Me Do”. Fans later found out Taylor was hiding with her boyfriend <br> Joe Alwyn in the period of time where she had disappeared. She had dated Joe Alwyn <br> for 6 years, but they shockingly broke up in 2022.

Taylor had to start re-recording her Big Machine albums in 2021, due to her albums <br> being sold without her permission. She wanted ownership of her albums, so she named <br> her re-recorded albums Taylor’s Version. Taylor Swift has remained a famous and loved <br> artist to this day.
